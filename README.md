3. Unzip the zip archive in a folder, say C:\flutter\
4. Update the system path to include flutter bin directory(C:\flutter\bin)
5. Open cmd and run 'flutter --version' to check if everything is ok
6. Start Android Studio > Configure > Plugins and install Flutter plugin, click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin
7. Open cmd and run 'flutter doctor' command - with 'Flutter', 'Android toolchain' and 'Android studio' configuration everything should be fine
8. Enable developer options on your phone > open project in Android studio > connect phone using USB
